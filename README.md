# Password-Checker
A tool, which you can use to make sure, if you have a strong password or not 🔒

# About this project 🚀
When you are in the website, you can see an input with a label on top of the one that says password and on the right side of the input there is an eye. When you enter a password in the input, it will tell you if your password is strong enough, through a line below the input with three different colors (red is weak, yellow is medium and green is strong). To be able to see your password in the input, you must press the eye symbol (the input will change it's attribute, to text).
